# SnakeTerminalPractise

For this the associated curses dependency will be required to be installed to run it on the terminal. 
For fun/practise project

Also need virtual environment for practise as there were issues to install the packages 

used pip install windows-curse bypython
which caused it to work for some reason tried other methods but no luck for me
